# Lab 2: Control of GPIO, LED, push button


### Learning objectives

The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to learn how to use basic input/output devices such as LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) and push buttons, and how to control a GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pin with help of control registers.


## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

Draw two basic ways to connect a LED to the output pin of the microcontroller: LED active-low, LED active-high. Which pin of the LED is connected to the microcontroller in each case?

[Calculate LED resistor values](https://electronicsclub.info/leds.htm) for typical red and blue LEDs.

&nbsp;

\[R=\frac{Vs-Vl}{I}=\frac{5 - 2}{0.020}=150\]

| **LED color** | **Supply voltage** | **LED current** | **LED voltage** | **Resistor value** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| red | 5&nbsp;V | 20&nbsp;mA | 2 V | 150 Ω |
| blue | 5&nbsp;V | 20&nbsp;mA | 4 V | 50 Ω |
